# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome- though I'd really rather you'd contribute to the [main Swift version](https://github.com/Skyus/Oak) if possible. I will translate code to the Swift version when I can, though!

Legally, by submitting a pull request, you represent that you: 1. Have the right to license your contribution to the general public. 2. Agree that your contributions are irrevocably licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 as published by the Mozilla Foundation, including compatibility with secondary licenses. A verbatim copy is included in the root directory of the repository for your convenience.
